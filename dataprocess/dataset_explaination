Due to the Github only can submit the file within 25MB, so I have put the dataset on Google Drive, 
This is the link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fMlHLjBEw_wbNvvwqVEDFBU4WfJCfgPC?usp=sharing

file name: "ai_original_dataset";
it is the original dataset. Using for the first section(Import dataset) in the code script

file name: "afterpreprocess";
it is the  dataset after performing "Basic preprocessing" procedure;
because this setp will take a long time. you can just use this dataset directly rather than performing the whole code in the "Basic preprocessing" procedure.   

file name: "sentimentlabel";
It is the dataset that ramdomly sampled and labelled the tweet sentiment by the author.
